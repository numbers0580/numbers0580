### Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Disclaimer: While inspired by true events, the following story is fictional and does not depict any actual person or events.

Setting: Hotel conference room. A sizable audience is in attendance.

Host: "Okay, who's next?"  

Me: (raises my hand)  

Host: "Glad to have a volunteer! Please share your story."  

Me: "Hi, everyone. My name is Peter Wood... and I am a Software Engineer."  

Audience: "Hi, Peter."  

Me: "It's been about 12 hours since I last coded ..."  

Host: "Peter, I'm sorry. I think you have the wrong room. This is not for recovering Software Engineers. Is that even a thing?"  

Me: (ignoring everyone): "It all started when I was a kid, maybe 12 or 13 years old. I was playing video games, and I recall myself saying, 'This game would be better if ...'"  

Host: "Seriously, Peter, wrong room! I'll get the hotel clerk to help you find the right meeting for ..."  

Me: "... I excelled in Math and the sciences. As a result, I was invited to enroll in a Computer Programming class in high school. I immediately fell in love. You see, while I was advancing in the natural sciences, I struggled and floundered with anything creative. I couldn't draw or paint, write, play music, or dance. But programming bridged that logical side of my mind with the budding creative side. And yes, I felt a rush -- a high -- I never felt before, and I craved more ..."  

Hotel Clerk: "Hello, sir. If you'll please follow me, I can help you find the conference room you're ..."  

Me: "... over the years I have learned C++ in high school, taught myself HTML/CSS, Javascript, Java, Android, and more recently learned React, Redux, Spring, and Data Structures & Algorithms with Python from Lambda School ..."  

Security Guards: (while approaching me) "Sir! Please step down from the podium!"  

Me: (using the audience as a barrier in a game of Keep-Away) "... I've been addicted to programming for longer than anything else now. But I can't stop -- won't stop -- because programming is my art form. To everyone here today, I want to tell you that addictions can be good. Addictions can be fun. They can be rewarding."  

Audience: (laughs as security guards finally catch me)  

Me: (while being dragged away by the arms) "You just need to find the right addiction, the perfect addiction to give your life meaning. I am a proud programming addict, and so can you!"
